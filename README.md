# Django REST API with ReDoc Documentation

This project demonstrates a basic Django RESTful API with integrated ReDoc documentation using the `drf-yasg` package.

## Project Overview

The project is designed to help developers understand how to create, document, and deploy a Django REST API. It includes a basic setup for a Django application with a sample API endpoint.

### Features

- **Django REST Framework**: Easily create RESTful APIs with Django.
- **ReDoc Documentation**: Generate beautiful, customizable API documentation.
- **Swagger Documentation**: Create interactive, machine and human-readable API documentation..

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher
- Django 4.2.15
- pip (Python package installer)
- Git (for version control)

### Installation Steps

1.  **Create a virtual environment:**

    To isolate your project's dependencies, create a virtual environment.

    bash

    Copy code

    `python -m venv venv`

2.  **Activate the virtual environment:**

    -   On **Windows**:

        bash

        Copy code

        `.\venv\Scripts\activate`

    -   On **macOS/Linux**:

        bash

        Copy code

        `source venv/bin/activate`

    After activating the virtual environment, your terminal prompt should change to reflect that you're working inside the virtual environment.

3.  **Install dependencies:**

    Install the necessary Python packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

    bash

    Copy code

    `pip install -r requirements.txt`

4.  **Apply migrations:**

    Prepare the database by applying migrations.

    bash

    Copy code

    `python manage.py migrate`

5.  **Run the development server:**

    Start the Django development server.

    bash

    Copy code

    `python manage.py runserver`

    By default, the server will start at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`. You can visit this URL in your web browser to see the project running.
